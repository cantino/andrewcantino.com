In this lab for <A href=http://palantir.swarthmore.edu/maxwell/classes/e126/S05/>Advanced Computer Graphics</a>, I add a ray-tracing option to my modeling/rendering system from last semester.

<b>A False Start</b><br>
I started by designing an interface in Cocoa, thinking that, like the last two labs, I would do this one in Cocoa from the ground up.  However, on second thought, I realized that it would be much simpler to add a ray tracer to my existing modeling system from last semester.  All that would be needed would be some new primitives and the basic ray tracing algorithm.
<p>
<b>Integration into the Scanline Renderer</b><br>
In order to integrate into last semester's scanline rendering and modeling system, I added a new output method to our view class.  Additionally, the following changes were made:
<ul>
<li>ray class -- has a vector3D location and a vector3D normalized direction, knows how to extend itself by a constant t.
<li>intersect class -- represents a ray/object intersection; contains the intersection location, t-value (distance along the ray to the intersection point), surface material properties, and surface normal. 
<li>xformWorld -- a new method to apply an arbitrary transformation matrix recursively to the entire model hierarchy.  This is very similar to the methods from last semester that output triangles in their final locations in the CVV.  However, now we can transform the world in any way as a pre-process to the ray tracing using this recursive method.  Each supported primitive type (currently polygon3D, polygonMesh3D, and sphere) must implement xformWorld.  Additionally, xformWorld returns a list of all of the lights in the world in their final positions.
<li>doIntersect -- given a ray, an intersect list, and a model (usually a model hierarchy), doIntersect recursively goes through the model hierarchy and does intersection checks on each object, adding any intersections to the intersect list.  Each supported primitive type (currently polygon3D, polygonMesh3D, and sphere) must implement doIntersect.
<li>Intersection code for polygons ported from shadow ray code from last semester; intersection code for spheres added.
<li>sphere class -- contains intersection code, a location, and a radius; built into the same class hierarchy as used last semester.
</ul>
<p>
The ray tracer pseudo-code looks like the following:<pre>
raytrace:
	Translate -VRP, alignAxes to the uvec, vup, and vpn vectors (all orthonormalized)
	Translate by d (this is not really necessary)
	Apply xformWorld with the above transformations and receive the light list
	for (x = -screenX / 2, y = -screenY / 2; x < screenX / 2, y < screenY / 2; x++, y++)
		colorVector pColor = colorVector(0, 0, 0);
		for (jitter = 0; jitter < number of samples per pixel; jitter++)
			Pick a random jittered sub-pixel location --
				jx = (du/(double)screenX) * (drand48() - .5)
				jy = (dv/(double)screenY) * (drand48() - .5)
			Make a ray from the origin to a pixel on a 'screen' at z = d:
				(x/(double)(screenX / 2.0))*du + jx, (y/(double)(screenY / 2.0))*dv + jy, d)
			Call doRayTrace recursively with the model hierarchy, the ray, and a
					recurse depth limit (explained below), receive colorVector c
			If c is (0,0,0), then set it to the background color
			Add c to pColor, weighting it by one over the number of jitter samples per pixel.
		Draw the pixel at (x + screenX / 2, y + screenY / 2) with color = 255*pColor

doRayTrace:
	Call doIntersect on the ray and model hierarchy
	Sort the resulting intersect list based on distance
	If intersection(s) were found, look at the closest one
		colorVector c is lit by ambient lighting based on the intersection material properties
		For every light in the model hierarchy
			If not backface
				Send a shadow ray to the light source
				If not in shadow, add to c lambertian and phong lighting based on
						the intersection location and material properties
		If the surface is reflective, and we're not at our recursion limit
			Call doRayTrace on a reflection ray in the direction of perfect reflection
							and a decremented recursion depth counter
			Add the resulting colorVector, weighted by the reflectivity, to c
	Return c</pre>
<p>

All of these changes were built (hopefully) nondestructively into the system from last semester.  A given model hierarchy should be renderable with either the raytracer or the scanline system simply by calling a different output method in the view class.  However, not all output modes are allowed on all primitives.  For example, sphere doesn't know how to output itself as a triangle list at this point, but a modeling hierarchy made up only of polygons should, in theory, be renderable with either output method.
