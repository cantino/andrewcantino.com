			<b>Ant Harvesting Simulation</b> in Second Life

		<b>Introduction</b><br>
		<p>In this project, I have created a simulation of ant harvesting
		behavior.  While I make no claims that the mechanics of this simulation
		are what real ants actually do, I was inspired by research into real
		ants, and so some parts of the simulation are arguably realistic.</p>

		<p>My simulation is run in <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second
		Life</a>, an online 3D environment where all content is user created --
		it is much like a 3D World Wide Web.  As such, it is very appealing as
		an environment for testing and prototyping interesting ideas, both
		programmatically and geometrically.  There are a number of science and
		math related projects in Second Life, including some involving Artificial Life <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070308-second-life.html">[1]</a>

		<b>Real Ants</b><br>
		<p>Army ants move and forage in large columns made up of thousands of
		ants.  When an army ant finds some prey, it will head back to the
		column, leaving a chemical recruitment trail.  When it encounters other
		army ants it will signal them to "search."  It will continue to wander
		around the column recruiting ants for some time.  When searching ants
		encounter the recruitment trail, they follow it to the prey.  Some of
		them will also become recruiters.  If no recruitment trail is found
		after some time, the recruited ants will continue on their way. [3]</p>
		
		<p>Recruitment strategies vary from one ant species to another.  A simple
		recruitment system seen in some ants (such as Camponotus sericeus) is
		dubbed "tandem running" [3].  In this strategy, a recruited ant must be
		lead to the prey through physical contact with a recruiting ant.  In a
		more advanced form, called "group recruitment," (seen in C. socius) the
		ants are oriented by a recruiter and then follow a chemical trail.  In
		"mass recruitment," ants will follow the trail after a recruiter tells
		them to "search" for it.  This is seen in Solenopsis invicta and Eciton
		hamatum, and is what I model.  Army ants hunt prey that can defend
		themselves against small numbers of ants, so this rapid recruitment is
		essential for successful harvesting behavior. [3]</p>

		<b>Future Work</b><br>
		<p>Further work could look at self-organization in ant colonies.  For
		example, some ant species tend to organize such that each colony has its
		own area for foraging [4].  Additionally, further work could explore ant
		evolution.  Ants are selected at the group level, not the individual
		level, which leads to colony-oriented behavior [5]. Finally, ants have
		many fascinating behaviors that would be worth modeling, including ant
		food type specialization, group hunting, colony movement, visual
		orientation, raids on other social insects [4], etc.</p>
		
		<b>Press</b><br>
		<p>I released a version of the above video on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ehEzRUu4_RM">YouTube</a> in early April, and it was picked up by <a href="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2007/04/the_second_life.html">New World Notes</a>, a Second Life blog.  The blogger, Hamlet Au, interviewed me and saw the ants in Second Life for the article.  Subsequently, his article was picked up by <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/04/06/virtual_ants_simulat.html">Boing Boing</a>, <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/ants/clip-ant-simulator-hits-sl-250761.php">Kotaku</a>, <a href="http://www.greythumb.org/blog/index.php?/archives/201-Virtual-ants-in-Second-Life.html">Grey Thumb</a>, <a href="http://pacificrimx.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/ants-invade-second-life/">PacificRim Exchange</a>, and <a href="http://www.converj.com/blogs/converjed/archives/001854.html">Converjed</a>.</p>
